Admin abuse is Forbidden, If you see us admin spawn stuff, it is for testing,
and bug-hunting.

Our configs are on display for public scrutiny
WE are the ONLY server that does this :)

Blow planets up before mining, please.

Quick List of Server Config Changes:

Owned Systems are now the only way to generate Faction Points
you can however, buy Faction Points with Credits on a 1FP:$10k
with  !Buy_FP <# of FP Desired>

Shield Capacitator's are stronger by about 10x but feel the effects
of the Diminishing Returns more aggressively, meaning the more shield
blocks you have the less you get per block.

Shield Rechargers are now stronger the more you have in a group,
the same way Power Capacitors work.

The mat's required for shields have switched, Caps need orange asteroids.

To make any color hull, just chose and go, no more paint
the req's are the same as Grey Hull.

Lava can be placed in the Micro-assembler and made into 
Alloyed Metal Mesh and Crystal Composite.

Gold Bars can be made in the Micro-Ass. 1000000 rock = 1 gold bar.

Power Capacitors are now stronger, this is to deepen power management meta.

Purely decorative blocks now give huge bonuses to Structure HP,
they represent backup/redundant systems.

Asteroid specific minerals are now used in all crafting above support systems
Tekt,Cinnabar,Varis,Dolom,Larimar,  etc...

Mining bonuses/penalties for system ownership have been removed
you now get the same amount wherever you are.

Warpgates are effectively unlimited in distance.
